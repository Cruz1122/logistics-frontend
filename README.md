## Technologies

- **Framework:** React 19 with Vite for a fast development experience.
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit with `redux-persist` to retain state across sessions.
- **Routing:** React Router v7 for declarative and protected routing.
- **HTTP Client:** Axios for making requests to the backend API Gateway.
- **Maps and Geolocation:** Google Maps API, integrated via `@react-google-maps/api`, to display maps and draw routes.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.IO Client to receive live location updates from the `geo-service`.
- **UI Components:** Combination of custom components and icons from `react-icons` and `antd`.
- **Notifications:** `react-toastify` for friendly, non-intrusive alerts.
- **Authentication:** Client-side handling of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure session management.
